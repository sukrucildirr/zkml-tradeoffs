# zkML Tradeoffs: Accuracy vs. Proving Cost

## Introduction
This project explores the tradeoffs between model accuracy and proving cost in zkML applications using the EZKL framework.

## Structure
- `data/`: Contains the datasets and preprocessed data.
- `models/`: Contains trained models and ONNX files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploration and analysis.
- `src/`: Source code for data preprocessing, model training, ONNX conversion, and proof generation.

## Usage
1. **Data Preprocessing and Feature Extraction:**
   ```bash
   python src/preprocessing.py
